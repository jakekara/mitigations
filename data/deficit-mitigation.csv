education, many states voluntarily support these costs through
their Medicaid programs.  In Connecticut, nearly 70% of the
state's hospitals are slated to receive Medicaid payments
totaling $21.1 million in FY 2018.  This proposal eliminates
these payments for the balance of the fiscal year.  Savings

costs that exceed this amount.  Connecticut is one of only a

proposal reduces reimbursement to 90%, consistent with the
level in place under Executive Order 58.  Savings figures reflect

these funds for clothing and other personal needs. This
proposal reduces the monthly PNA from $60 to $50, which is in
line with the average for the states in the Northeast and is $20
above the federal minimum.  Savings figures reflect the state's
share of Medicaid expenditures.  After factoring in the federal
share, this proposal will reduce total Medicaid expenditures by
